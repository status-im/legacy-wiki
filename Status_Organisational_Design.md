# Purpose of this Document

Currently the design of the organisation has been done in a as-needed
basis, as a result there is a lack of clarity in understanding of the
organisational structure. This has resulted in confusion from sparse
information, lack of focus, overwhelming contributors, encapsulation and
a semi-hierarchical org chart. All of these traits are the very opposite
of what Status is about.

Here I’m looking to solve 3 problems:

1.  Get clarity and export knowledge(documentation) in all endeavours
    the organisation undertakes, before we undertake them. So anyone can
    understand the shared vision, requirements and plan of the Idea,
    before and during its execution.
2.  Discover a way of bounding our scope to keep all endeavours bound by
    organisational capacity.
3.  Ensuring openness, transparency and permissionless participation are
    integral components in the organisation’s design.

With this document I am to present my view on the overall organisation
and a unified framework for all subsequent organizational changes,
process designs and can be used directly for many operations within the
organisation.
