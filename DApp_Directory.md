While the Ethereum network is still in its infancy, the rate of
decentralized applications on the platform is already growing
drastically. The Status DApp Directory provides a way for stakeholders
in the network to discover the most useful DApps, as curated by other
community members.

Much like the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, the Status DApp
directory will provide a way to navigate by category and rating,
enabling users to find exactly what they are looking for.
