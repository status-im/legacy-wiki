Hi, new user here. I have a job interview tomorrow with Status, and I
thought poking around in the wiki might be a good way to get a feel for
what's going on.

I have TONS of experience editing wikis in MediaWiki software and
others. On Wikipedia, I have somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 edits. In
a company internal wiki, that number is about 25,000 edits.

So now you know why I made a few edits to prominent pages already. :)
