## The Status Network

<big>A strategy towards mass adoption of Ethereum</big>

<small>Draft for open community review. Subject to change.</small>

### Executive Summary

Status is an open source messaging platform and mobile interface to
interact with decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum
Network.

This document presents a utility network token for Status, the first
ever mobile Ethereum client built entirely on peer-to-peer technologies.

The messenger form-factor is chosen to make Ethereum feel as familiar as
possible to the average smartphone user, while providing a flexible
platform for DApp developers, aimed to maximise the amount of daily use
of Ethereum’s public blockchain.

The Status Network token is a modular utility token that fuels the
Status network. This includes a Decentralized Push Notification Market,
Governance of the Status client, Community Curation of content, along
with social communication tools such as Tribute to Talk. We also propose
a fiat-to-crypto 'Teller Network', DApp Directory, Sticker Market, and
demonstrate our research on a User Acquisition Engine to grow the
Network.

The Status Network Token (‘SNT’) will be distributed at a rate of 10,000
SNT per 1 ETH to participants in the Contribution Period, and is
expected to begin on June 20th. The Contribution Period will run for 14
days, or within 24 hours of the first ceiling of 12M CHF (Swiss Francs)
having been reached (outlined on Page 27).

### Background

Prevalent on the internet today are social bots, a type of automated
software that controls a social media account, designed to advocate
certain ideas, support campaigns, and sway public relations. These bots
pollute online discussion by lending false credibility to their messages
and influence of real users ([Ferrara et
al. 2016a](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204021-the-rise-of-social-bots/fulltext),
[Aiello et
al. 2012](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM12/paper/download/4523/4961)).
Recent studies quantify the extent to which automated systems can
dominate discussions on Twitter about topics ranging from electronic
cigarettes ([Clark et
al. 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157304))
to elections ([Bessi and
Ferrara 2016](http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7090/5653)).
Recent conservative estimates claim 15% of all Twitter users are said to
be bots ([Varol and Ferrara 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03107)).
Twitter has 319 million monthly active users as of 2016, suggesting that
47.8 million users are bots. This poses a threat to the legitimacy of
the media we consume.

The problem of social bots and media manipulation serves as a catalyst
in re-evaluating how we design our social networks and is just one
symptom that is systemic in the user-as- product business model. In this
paper we will present our ideas for the next generation social network,
the **socio-economic network**.

Carl and Jarrad, the co-founders of Status, have had a working
relationship for 6 years on various projects, and 3 of those years were
spent operating a software distribution network, driving over 20 million
installs to various software o erings, the profits of which were used to
fund Status and our team of 10 until this point. During the operation of
this business we were uniquely positioned to see firsthand how personal
data on the internet is bought and sold and how users are acquired and
retained.
