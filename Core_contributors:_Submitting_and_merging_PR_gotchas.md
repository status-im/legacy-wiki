Some things to keep in mind for submitting and merging PRs in
status-react:

1\) Submit PR to \`status-im/status-react\` origin, not your fork (this
triggers build/makes it easier to share work)

2\) Squash PR to one commit

3\) Normally @roman is merging, but if you are merging, use "rebase and
merge" option
