# User Story

As a dapp creator, I want to know if my dapp is running in status so
that I can show users Status relevant info and logos.

# Description

Type: Feature

Summary: Many Dapps show a Metamask logo by default, but wouldn't it be
cool if Dapps running in Status could show a Status logo and offer users
Status relevant information?

# Expected behavior

`web3.currentProvider.isStatus` returns `true`

# Actual behavior

nada

# Solution

Implement `web3.currentProvider.isStatus`
