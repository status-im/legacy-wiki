One major drawback in legacy social networks is the lack of influence
their users possess over the networks themselves. They are often
powerless in having a say on how the platform evolves. We aim to
democratise this power, giving stakeholders a direct influence over all
decisions within the network, including how the software is developed.

A core part of the Status Network Token is giving stakeholders the
ability to choose the direction that the software is developed. The
token is used to make decisions on proposals, which can be made by any
Stakeholder. For each decision, the token is cloned into a separate
decision token. The amount of tokens you hold at that time becomes your
voting power for that decision and it does not cost SNT to vote.

Initially, key decisions will be put towards software development. We
have already created a Github Bounty bot,
[Commiteth](https://commiteth.com/), which allows us to decentralize and
incentivise open source software development, by enabling anyone to
create bounties for any Github Issue. These can then be paid to the
developer upon submitting code that is successfully merged into the
codebase by the Project Maintainer.

Decentralizing additional components of Status' governance needs to
happen over time, given the sheer complexity of the task. We have been
closely monitoring the progress of decentralized governance projects in
the space including Aragon, Boardroom, and Colony.
