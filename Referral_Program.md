There are lots of ways you can help grow Status (interviewing, helping
out with events, engaging with the community, etc.), but referring
outstanding people is one of the most direct ways you can make an
impact.

While referrals do have a much higher pass through rate than regular
applications, there may be a chance that your referral won’t be hired
the first time they're submitted. This might happen because of:

  - Timing: Their qualifications don't match roles currently available.
  - Matching: They don't meet all of the minimum requirements listed for
    the role.
  - Competition: There was someone else who was more qualified.
  - Demand: The the role was reduced or closed.
  - For referrals who are eventually hired, they are usually considered
    for multiple roles over a period of time.

## Referral Checklist

We want you to tell us about people who do incredible work and you’d
want on your team. Not sure where to start? Here are the basics of
successful referrals.

### Step 1: Only refer the best people you have ever worked with

Three out of four referrals start with the candidate asking you to refer
them. While you should definitely share people whose work you can speak
to and are impressed by (i.e. the top 25% of people you’ve worked with),
don’t feel pressured to refer everyone who asks. If you feel
uncomfortable saying no (we get it, it can be awkward), check out these
tips on how to politely pass.

  - **Reminder: diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences leads
    to better products**. When you refer talent from underrepresented
    groups, particularly into technical positions, you’re doing your
    part to make sure we have a diverse workforce across all functions
    and
levels.

### Step 2: Submit them through [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/NcDtqFX5PIPy1g4X2)

When you create a referral, you only need to share your referral’s
contact information and why you think they’d be great for Status. The
team reads the notes when reviewing referrals, so this can really help
your candidate stand out among other qualified candidates.

### Step 3: Support them through the process

Staffing will guide your candidates through the process, but you can
provide a critical layer of support to your referral. You can make a big
difference by doing one of the following:

  - Helping them prep for interviews or inclusion activities.
  - Answering questions about working at Status and your experiences.
  - If they get an offer, helping us convince them to accept their
    offer\!
