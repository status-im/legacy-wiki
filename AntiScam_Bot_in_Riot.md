'''Status has an Anti-Spam feature active in our Riot. This is to
prevent regular users from attempting to scam / spam others. ''' Links
by default are blacklisted, until they are added to the whitelist.

DM's are by default not allowed from user \> user unless the user has
been added to the moderators list.

List of commands:

Adding a URL to the whitelist: $url add \<\>

Listing current whitelisted URLs: $url list

Adding a moderator (please ask before adding to the list): $mods add
@example:status.im

Listing available moderators: $mods list

Being an active moderator gives you the ability for others to DM you and
you to DM them as well as whitelisting links and adding other
moderators. A master server admin is still required to make any room
changes.
