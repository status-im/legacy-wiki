Inspired by one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original suggested use cases for
Bitcoin, we will be introducing an economics-based anti-spam filter, in
our case for receiving messages and “cold” contact requests from users.

This enables stakeholders to set a minimum amount of SNT that a Status
stakeholder must deposit in order for someone outside of their network
to contact him directly. If the recipient replies the deposit is
forfeited to the recipient.\\

**SNT Utility**

  - SNT is deposited, and transferred from stakeholders to recipients
    upon receiving a reply from the recipient.

**Example use-cases**

  - Stakeholder A, a professional, would like to reach out to a high
    profile figure in the same industry, but would otherwise have no
    means of receiving a response.
  - Stakeholder B, an artist and celebrity wishes to spend some time
    chatting with fans, and also desires a means of monetizing their fan
    base.
  - Stakeholder C, a freelancer, provides photography tutorials, and has
    a means of generating revenue.
