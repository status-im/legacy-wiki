# <span class="c16">編輯推送通知消息 - 我們在哪裡</span>

<span class="c1">`September 22th`Oskar Thorén撰寫. `October 2` and
`October 3`附錄更新.</span>

## <span class="c5">本文件的目標</span>

<span class="c1">確保人們在相同的頁面上</span>

<span class="c1">1) 推送當前狀態的通知消息,</span>

<span class="c1">2) 限制是什麼，</span>

<span class="c1">3) 誰在做，最重要的是，</span>

<span class="c1">4)
決定未來幾週的優先工作。</span>

## <span class="c5">本文</span>

<span class="c1">請引用我在最初的推送通知提案文件\[1\]中寫的內容，因為它現在與當時一樣重要：</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c13">據我所知，以“推送通知”名義開展的工作已經進行了六個月。有許多原因尚未實施，但其中一個原因是它沒有適當的範圍。按照項目的權力法律
(</span><span class="c9 c13">[<https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/21/power-law-projects/>](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/21/power-law-projects/&sa=D&ust=1507288643409000&usg=AFQjCNHy_U6PlJ5ZYEcpyRTv131bj92GMA)</span><span class="c13">)預計按現在的速度還需要六個月。</span><span class="c13">阻止這種情況發生的唯一方法是積極削減範圍</span><sup>[\[a](#cmnt1 "wikilink")\]</sup><span class="c13 c15">，把事情分解成它們的本質，然後交付。</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">從那以後你可以在上面再添加50天。</span>

## <span class="c5">當前狀態</span>

<span>在我們每晚的構建中，推送通知的MVP已經實現\[2\]。
</span><span>此功能隱藏在標誌後面</span><sup>[\[b](#cmnt2 "wikilink")\]</sup><span>，和</span><span>它並未包含在0.9.11發布候選版本中</span><sup>[\[c](#cmnt3 "wikilink")\][\[d](#cmnt4 "wikilink")\]</sup><span class="c1">.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>MVP解決了這個特定的用戶故事：
</span><span class="c13 c17">作為用戶，當我的聯繫人中的某個人向我發送消息時，我希望收到推送通知提醒，並且我的應用程序已處於後台，這樣我就不必始終將應用程序置於前台。</span>

### <span>目前設計和實施的局限性</span><sup>[\[e](#cmnt5 "wikilink")\]</sup>

  - <span class="c1">L1 UX: 它只能在1對1聊天中使用</span>

<!-- end list -->

  - <span class="c1">L2 用戶體驗(UX): 您必須將該人添加為聯繫人</span>
  - <span class="c1">L3 用戶體驗(UX): 它只適用於短信，而不是命令（如/發送，/位置等） \[3\]</span>
  - <span>L4 用戶體驗(UX): 通知不包括發件人或消息，所以
    </span><span>消息可能會丟失</span><sup>[\[f](#cmnt6 "wikilink")\][\[g](#cmnt7 "wikilink")\]</sup>
  - <span class="c1">L5 技術/第三方風險：取決於Firebase並與其緊密結合</span>
  - <span class="c1">L6 技術/常規安全：Firebase SERVER_KEY包含在二進製文件中
    \[4\]</span>
  - <span class="c1">L7 技術/垃圾郵件：用戶A可以在B觸發無限通知</span>
  - <span>L8 技術/黑暗路由：用戶A擁有B的FCM代幣，並且
    </span><span>Firebase知道A和B.</span><sup>[\[h](#cmnt8 "wikilink")\][\[i](#cmnt9 "wikilink")\]</sup>
  - L9 技術/追踪：包含的Firebase Analytics包含在react-native-fcm中 \[**已修正**\] \[5\]
  - <span class="c1">L10
用戶體驗(UX)＆加速移動網頁(amp)技術：通知發送到設備，而不是帳戶</span>

## <span class="c5">資源</span>

<span>隨著里卡多(Ricardo)離開Status，目前奧斯卡(Oskar)是唯一一個從事這項工作的人。據我所知，</span><span>Clojure方面有多一個人和Go方面有多一個人</span><sup>[\[l](#cmnt12 "wikilink")\][\[m](#cmnt13 "wikilink")\][\[n](#cmnt14 "wikilink")\][\[o](#cmnt15 "wikilink")\][\[p](#cmnt16 "wikilink")\]</sup><span class="c1">，在工作方面還有待完成。根據優先級，我可以繼續單獨工作（Clojure＆amp;
Go），但顯然需要更長的時間/更少的事情可以並行完成。</span>

## <span class="c5">選項</span>

<span class="c1">這是我看到的主要工作。如果我們有多個人在這方面工作，這些顯然可以並行完成。</span>

### <span class="c14">A) 包含消息中隱藏的有效載 (L4)</span>

<span class="c1">This requires:</span>

  - <span>Androi</span><span class="c1">d: get data payload when
    resuming app from bg (status-go changes) \[6, 7\]</span>
  - <span class="c1">Extend status-go API to take notification and data
    payloads</span>
  - <span class="c1">Figure out routing from open app to adding payload
    to relevant chat db</span>
  - <span class="c1">When sending notification, include necessary info
    add payload to relevant chat db</span>
  - <span class="c1">Encrypting notification with key receiver (contact)
    can decrypt upon opening app</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Main drawback:</span>

  - <span class="c1">If you send 10 messages, each notification alert
    has to be clicked on to see it in app</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Main alternative:</span>

  - <span class="c1">Leave it as it is and use offline inboxing to
    retrieve messages when user opens app</span>

### <span class="c14">B) Increase basic UX capabilities (L1-L3)</span>

<span class="c1">Address UX weaknesses. Combating L1 requires figuring
out how to exchange FCMToken among many participant, extending status-go
public API, and it also increases L8
risk.</span>

### <span class="c14">C) Use something like a notification service (L7 and L8, L4? L10?)</span>

<span>Continue work done by Victor and Ricardo. This is the part I’m
least familiar with. The work has unfortunately mostly been done in the
past, and, recently, in isolation from the current status-react app and
real devices. As far as I can tell it addresses limitations L7, L8 and
possibly L4 (but w/o E2E encryption for actual Firebase notification?)
and L10. What limitations in the current implementation this addresses
should be made explicit, as well as what problems it introduces. For
example, it currently introduces another failure mode & increase
centralization by requiring a Whisper node to be run in a cluster that
we control. If we use this it should be added in small pieces in a way
th</span><span class="c1">at augments the current design and
implementation and can be done and used in a timely manner.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">See \[8-13\] below.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

## <span class="c5">Addendum October 2</span>

<span class="c1">Initially a comment by Oskar.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">In retrospect I could've written the state of PN
document a bit differently. It is assuming that the work which \*can be
done\* with PN are necessarily highest prio. I think if we could get a
basic proof of concept for offline inboxing, which really has nothing to
do with PN, then this would have big consequences for PN. PN work A
would disappear and work C would probably be changed, at least
somewhat.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">To me, as an end user, offline inboxing is a much
bigger problem for real use right now. It'd be pretty cool if we could
get a very basic version of this working before devcon.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Additionally, I think the general notifications problem
can best be seen as one instance of a "signal" of sorts in an attention
market. I think this is what @jarradhope hinted at in the whitepaper,
but generalized and ties into reputation systems for normal messages etc
too. I'm still formulating my thinking around this problem. I think this
can be one of the main differentiators between Status and other
IMs/browsers/app-stores.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">The use of the word "decentralized" should also be
qualified and we have to be more precise about language and what
problems are we solving. I tried to outline the main limitations of the
current approach in the above google doc, and the only thing that makes
it not decentralized is Firebase. So unless a proposal actually get rids
of that, it doesn't make any difference in that respect. in fact,
introducing a specific role for a Whisper node in our cluster
\*increases\* centralization and failure modes / robustness.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">This is also why I'm a bit against these static squads.
Now we are talking in a squads-notifications channel. The language we
use shape our thoughts, and the way I personally conceptualize many of
the immediate problems we want to solve have very little to do with push
notifications per se (offline inboxing, attention market). I think this
easily leads to clouded thinking. The things that are related to push
notifications per se (getting rid of Firebase, design for actual push
notification and deep linking into app, etc) are not thing we are
talking much about at all, and they don't necessarily seem like highest
prio right now either.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

## <span class="c5">Addendum October 3</span>

<span>It was decided at devcon3 release meeting yesterday (Monday) that
basic user story together with removing FB Analytics
(</span><span class="c9">[<https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/1877>](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/1877&sa=D&ust=1507288643417000&usg=AFQjCNFU5k7rSwSSEyAO9wkBzxdllDyf1A)</span><span class="c1">,
pending QA) is good enough of a deliverable for devcon. Next step in
this general sphere of problems is probably offline inboxing; this will
be elaborated on in a separate
    document.</span>

[\[a](#cmnt_ref1 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">agreed, we need to do
this with many aspects of our development, get to MVP as fast as
possible</span>

<div class="c0">

[\[b](#cmnt_ref2 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Really like this, again I
would like to see this happen across all features, and as suggested, we
should have a discussion about this vs eliminating epic/ branches</span>

[\[c](#cmnt_ref3 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Can we have a reference
link to the recent build with the feature enabled? I was trying to test
it but realized that I didn't have the right build on one of the two
devices.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[d](#cmnt_ref4 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Latest nightly build
should work fine</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[e](#cmnt_ref5 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">All these limitations are
fine.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[f](#cmnt_ref6 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Can we clarify this? It
means that if a notification is seen, the message it refers to might be
already not available because of the nature of the protocol?</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[g](#cmnt_ref7 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Since there currently is
nothing in the notification payload, if you click no notification and
more than X minutes have passed the message will have disappeared (since
we don't have offline inboxing yet)</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[h](#cmnt_ref8 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">What does Firebase know
about A and B?</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[i](#cmnt_ref9 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Since request to Firebase
comes from A, it at least knows A's IP.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">It also knows about B's device in the sense that a
FCMToken is tied to a device.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">It's a fairly advanced threat model though. There might
also be other similar unknown unknowns too of course.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[j](#cmnt_ref10 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">I recognize the need for
this, but it cannot make it into a production release.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[k](#cmnt_ref11 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">I agree. I'll see how
hard it is to remove this and if it requires upgrading React Native or
not over the next few days.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[l](#cmnt_ref12 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">I think features should
have team sizes of minimum 3 moving forward. Literature I've read 5
seems to be sweet spot, so we should aim for 5 and reduce amount of
things we are working on.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[m](#cmnt_ref13 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">Focusing on fewer things
and getting them done faster would indeed be desirable. The main concern
here is to make sure the work can be parallelized, so we aren't stepping
on each other's toes / people in a squad are blocked a lot.</span>

</div>

<div class="c0">

[\[n](#cmnt_ref14 "wikilink")\]<span class="c1">FYI I am happy to join
this project from status-go side. It looks pretty interesting to
me.</span>
