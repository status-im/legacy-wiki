*“A PM has the brain of an engineer, heart of a designer, tongue of a
diplomat”*

PM’s have 4 main tasks:

1.  Leadership
2.  Organizational influence
3.  Productivity
4.  Communication

## Leadership

  - Leadership in a team is received through **inspiring others**. Those
    who inspire others in a team cause things to happen.
  - PM’s are not somebody’s boss just because they have some
    responsibility. You cannot try to tell anybody what to do.
      - Rather, your role is to set goals and ambitions.

  - The vision of the end goal comes, and must come from you, the PM.
      - Articulate a **clear product strategy**.
  - **Success Metrics**. Know your stats. Be paranoid about them. Know
    your top 3 KRs off by heart.

## Organizational Influence

  - The responsibility of a PM is not managerial, it's janitorial. Your
    task is to make sure that the team has everything it needs to
    self-organize.
  - Listen to people’s feedback. Make sure people are comfortable
    communicating with you.
  - **Data beats opinion**. This goes back to understanding your users,
    their problems and your success metrics. Support your ideas with
    data.
  - Influencing. It’s hard to get buy in from every single stakeholder.
    Create a close working relationship with your xfn leads, and get
    them to help with the heavy lifting.
  - Pick your battles aka *‘don’t die on the hill’*. Figure out what you
    really feel strongly about. Don’t die on the hill on your way to
    battle. “i defer to you” is a tremendous power.

## Productivity

  - [Big rocks
    first](https://zenhabits.net/big-rocks-first-double-your-productivity-this-week/).
    Have a doc with your big rocks open on your computer at all times.
    Check your big rocks when you do your most important things (MITs),
    and/or with your weekly newsletter.
  - Your only resource is your time. And here you have two approached:
    proactive or reactive. You can be 100% busy but make 0% progress on
    important things.
  - MITs. What are the most important things for you to do today? Try

## Communication

  - Come up with a **narrative for your product**. Tell it to everyone
    to everyone you talk to. Repeat it over, and over again.
      - Your 1 sentence elevator pitch must be polished. It can also
        change over time
  - **Weekly newsletter**: Come up with a weekly newsletter for your
    team. This is your weekly report card. Track this against your big
    rocks. Make sure everyone is CCd on your newsletter.
  - **Send meeting notes**. It makes the most of everyone’s time, and is
    a good opportunity for you to set the tone and run a tight ship.

## Onboarding

When you meet your team, here’s a recommendation of 4 questions you
should ask:

1.  What’s working well?
2.  What’s not working well?
3.  What should you do, that you’re not doing?
4.  What would you do if you were in my shoes?
