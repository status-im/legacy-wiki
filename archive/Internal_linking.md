# How to use it

  - If you want to link to "Article1" just tyle
    [Article1](Article1 "wikilink") anywhere in the wiki and an internal
    link will appear.
  - Even if "Article1" doesn't exist (but you think it should) you can
    still link to it (and will appear as a red non-existent link) and
    others may create it at some point
