What is a launch ðŸš€? A launch is a major release of the core app or
product, which can also be synchronized with a PR event (e.g. DevCon).
The definition of major may seem subjective, but we are all rational
people and should define if something is current a â€˜launchâ€™ or simply a
new feature or bug fix.

Example of a â€˜majorâ€™ release:

  - Status Hard Wallet is for sale
  - Status core application launches out of Beta
  - etc.
