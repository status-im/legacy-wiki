requires finding applications with the right balance of motivation,
knowledge and value for an open culture.

If you are unsure about a candidate, remember how important your
decision is to maintaining Status' culture. Err on the side of false
negatives, instead of false positives.

## SWE Interview Process

As an Open Source community, Status is uniquely positioned to include
all applicants in the project as part of the interview process. There
will be separate interview types for each function:

### Closure/Go Engineer:

1.  Candidate submits application and is requested to send a minimum of
    2 Pull Requests from a [Status
    Repository](Github.com/status-im "wikilink") or [Status Open
    Bounty](Openbounty.status.im "wikilink").
2.  HR Phone Screen.
3.  Team member who merged Pull Requests are consulted to provide
    feedback on code quality.
4.  Leadership interview

For software engineering interviews that are not able to find relevant
space in the repository or on Status Open Bounty (e.g. Smart Contract
developers, DevOps), they can submit an application with a Github link
in order to see relevant work in the applied field.

## Non-SWE Interview Process

For non-SWE interviews, there will be a more traditional hiring process.
This includes:

1.  CV screen
2.  HR phone screen
3.  Inclusion task (outlined below)
4.  45m interview with functional lead (Design/PM)
5.  45m Operations interview (i.e. Nabil)
