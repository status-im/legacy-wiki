In legacy social networks, ranking of information is typically done by
the platform owner, often with the intent of driving up profits. In this
model, content discovery algorithms are opaque, prone to censorship,
monopolistic in nature, and possess high switching costs should users of
the network become dissatisfied with the quality of content discovery.

Within the Status Network, stakeholders will be able to opt-in to curate
the content that is displayed by producing signatures on events (i.e. by
upvoting or downvoting content or ideas), referred to as signals, in
which the stakeholdersâ€™ token backing is weighted in ranking.

The aggregate signals generated from stakeholders form an open graph
that content rankers can use. Should a stakeholder be dissatisfied with
the content ranking by their current provider, they can choose between a
market of search algorithm providers, keeping algorithm providers honest
and removing the monopoly web 2.0 solutions have on the way we consume
information.

Status has formed a partnership with
[Userfeeds.io](https://userfeeds.io/) to lead this effort.

**SNT Utility**

  - SNT is required to opt-in for curation mechanisms.

**Example use-cases**

  - Stakeholder A, an early adopter, has moderate stake in the network,
    and has an economic incentive to see the content ranking remain
    high, and opts in for Community Curation.
  - Stakeholder B, a data scientist, believes he can improve upon a
    content algorithm and thus the value of the network, so purchases a
    larger stake in the Network and submits a new algorithm.
