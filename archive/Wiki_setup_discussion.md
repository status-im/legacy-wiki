## When does it replace google documents

  - They are pretty much the same for most of the use cases I have seen
    so far here, I would say the main difference is that Docs is more
    'live collaboration' when wiki is slightly more delayed as the
    discussion tab is just another wiki page

<!-- end list -->

  - Yes I see it the same way, ideally the wiki becomes the one-stop
    shop for everything, but we need more people (everyone on team)
    regularly contributing to it. Google Docs are great for the 'live
    editing and suggestion' environment

## What hierarchy to put in place to keep it organized ?

  - emulate the Arch Wiki as close as possible (they have amazing
    guidelines)

`think we should discuss the hierarchy as well; we talked about liking `<https://wiki.archlinux.org/>` before moving to mediawiki as the choice but I believe all should be public - i also was wondering about edit policy and asked about this; there seems to be some moderation extensions that can be put in place I looked at but didn't know anything official.`

## What kind of edit policy is going to be put in place ?

  - right now anybody can create an account and edit anything
  - I'm fine with this edit policy
  - what about scams ? defacing ?

## What about documents that are not meant to be public (yet ?) ?

  - It is possible to have private pages on the wiki, maybe an
    'internal' hierarchy where all pages are private ?
  - maybe just keep them in google docs ?

## Discipline regarding knowledge keeping ?

\[Knowledge-keeping guideline\]

  - when interesting questions are asked on slack maybe the person
    asking should have the responsibility to write a quick note in the
    wiki.
  - yes I would love love love this
