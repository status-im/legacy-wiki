This describes the sequence of events happening once a PR for an issue
with a bounty was merged by repo maintainer.

## Quick info on transaction hashes

In the sequence described below, several types of hashes are used. SOB
checks presence of different hashes on records in the issues table to
decide which action to take on an issue and associated contract. These
hashes are:

  - transaction_hash: set when contract is deployed to the labeled
    issue
  - execute_hash: set when PR for an issue with a bounty was merged
  - confirm_hash: fetched from receipt from transaction invoked in
    previous step
  - payout_hash: set when payout was confirmed via Manage Payouts

The event flow is given below. For the bounty to be paid, each issue has
to go through the steps in given order.

## PR closed and merged

  - app receives notification via GitHub App webhook (endpoint:
    /webhook-app)
  - handle-claim fn is invoked which will:
  - save PR in the pull_requests DB table, where state=1 for merged PRs
  - update issue in the DB with commit SHA, if PR was merged

Afterwards two interleaving sequences of actions come into play:
scheduler threads and manual user interaction in the Manage Payouts tab.

## self-sign-bounty scheduler thread

  - input query name: pending-bounties. This selects pending bounties
    (where execute_hash is nil and commit_sha is set)
  - execute payout transactions
  - store execute_hash and winner_login in issues DB table
  - update GitHub comment to "Pending maintainer confirmation"

## update-confirm-hash scheduler thread

  - input query name: pending-payouts. This selects bounties with
    execute_hash set and no confirm_hash
  - fetch confirm_hash from transaction receipt
  - store confirm_hash in issues DB table

## Manage Payouts view

In order to confirm a payout, following conditions have to be met for an
issue:

  - it is merged
  - not paid yet (meaning its payout_hash is nil)
  - not being confirmed at the moment (:confirming? flag is true) OR
  - already confirmed by a scheduler thread(confirm_hash is not nil)

Note that confirm_hash issue field and confirmation action in the UI
are different things, albeit identically named. In order to confirm a
payout from the UI, confirm_hash has to be already set by scheduler
thread (see above).

Payout confirmation action results in a :confirm-payout event. Its
handler will

  - use confirm_hash to construct transaction payload
  - set :confirming? flag to true
  - execute confirmTransaction() call
  - pass transaction callback to confirmTransaction(). Once invoked, the
    callback will:
  - get payout_hash passed as an argument
  - dispatch :save-payout-hash event. Its handler will:
      - POST to /api/user/bounty/%s/payout
          - This will update payout_hash in issues DB table
      - if POST is successful, dispatch :payout-confirmed
        \*:payout-confirmed will update :confirmed? to true and remove
        :confirming? flag

## update-payout-receipt scheduler thread

  - input query name: confirmed-payouts. This selects confirmed payouts
    (the ones that have payout_hash and do not have payout_receipt
    set)
  - store payout_receipt in issues DB table
  - and update GitHub comment to "Paid to:..."
