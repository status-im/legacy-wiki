One of the core hurdles to the adoption of cryptocurrency is the
diffculty in obtaining it. Ease of access is necessary to transition our
economies from fiat to digital currency.

In order to solve this problem, we propose the implementation of the
Status Teller Network, a D pp inside of Status, which provides
borderless, peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto ‘Teller Network’.

The Teller Network allows Stakeholders in the Network to find nearby
users to exchange their cash for digital assets and currency, giving any
smartphone owner in the world the ability to take control of their
personal wealth.

In this sense, Status becomes a piece of a “Web 3.0” banking
infrastructure and creates a global people-as-ATM network. This has
particular utility in developing markets where cash- based economies are
prevalent and credit card penetration remains low, tackling the famous
‘last-mile’ of the remittance market.

The growing trade volumes observed on LocalBitcoins, ~30M USD per week
([CoinDance 2017](https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins)), coupled
with the rise of remittance startups built on legacy systems like
TransferWise
([Crunchbase 2017](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/transferwise#/)),
serve as a testament to the viability of this model.
