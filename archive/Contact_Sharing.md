basic idea is to hash the pair of phone numbers (me, other) so that
there are many collisions and then publish this (plausible deniable,
because of collisions). and the contact your friend out of band if there
is a hash that could be a match (which it is most likely not).

General problem: - Data is readable by anyone - The problem is not so
much, that the server must not learn the contacts, but that - no one
must learn them, while all data is public

Alice announces its connection with Bob by:

calculating H(A_phone_number + B_phone_number) applying costly
scrypt or PBKDF2 hashing to derive H' truncating H’ to a low number of
bits H*, so that collisions are likely publicly registers its unique
pubkey_alice_bob for H* Notes so far: - rainbow tables of 10^10^2 size
(i.e. all phone number combinations) are impractical - calculating all
combinations is prohibitively costly - collisions of H’’ allow plausible
deniability - Problem: an adversary can impersonate Alice, need spam
protection (PoW) here

Bob wants to know if Alice is participating in the network: - Bob
calculates H(A_phone_number + B_phone_number) - Bob generates H’ and
H’' - for all matching entries for H’’ (including the one generated by
Alice) - Bob encrypts truncated H(mobile_bob) for pubkey_alice_bob -
and sends the message to Alice inbox on the server - Alice loads and
decrypts the message - Alice can match truncated H(mobile_bob) in hear
contact list with a very low false positive rate - if Alice thinks she
knows Bob, she might reply out of band

Notes: - Bob can still plausibly deny that he knows Alice - Bob can
still plausibly deny that he participates in the system - add some proof
of work or similar for spam protection

This is hard against: - Leaking users contact lists - An adversary with
a hypothesis about a connection can learn bobs phone number though

Limitations: - New users (Bob) won’t see others directly - Existing
users (Alice) need to invite Bob - Quite some computation and
communication overhead - ~ 500 x 10 messages send - 2x key pairs to
remember for each

Lame solution which is prone to rainbow table attacks.
