Based on MVP description of idea “Bounty for the Found Issue”
<https://github.com/status-im/ideas/issues/11> we will run several bug
hunting sessions to validate the proposed process inside Status team
before leveraging it further.

Current process (can be changed while we learn):

1.  Contributor registers to provide his/her ETH address on
    <https://openbounty.status.im/>
2.  Contributor reports an issue in the GitHub repo and specifies
    Bug-Bounty type in the issue description
3.  Reviewer adds a comment to the issue and if bug report is ok then
    add a label bug-bounty and label size (e.g. bug-bounty and M). If
    bug report not ok then explain why (ask for extra details, close if
    duplicate, etc)
4.  Team treasurer reviews new issues with "bug-bounty" label and sends
    SNT to the contributor's ETH address. Also adds a comment with
    transaction details.
5.  All bug hunting is done on specific build(s) within specified
    timeframe and functional scope (to be documented by bug hunt lead)
6.  You should not review your own issues
