## Universal Links (iOS) & Deep Links (Android)

#### What are Universal & Deep Links

With universal links (iOS) and deep links (android) mobile users can tap a link to Status and get seamlessly redirected to the Status app and linked to specified screens without going through the browser. If Status isnâ€™t installed, tapping a link to the Status website opens a Status website
with info on the link and instructions to download the mobile app.

#### What Links Are Supported

##### Public Chats

<https://get.status.im/chat/public/>**CHANNEL-NAME** eg
<https://get.status.im/chat/public/status>

##### DApp Browser

<https://get.status.im/browse/>**DAPP-ADDRESS** eg
