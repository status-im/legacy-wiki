Due to the decentralised nature of Status and the relatively recent
field of crypto-economics and mechanism design, many of the things weâ€™re
trying to accomplish requires deep thought. Research is largely involved
in thinking about how to build these systems, as well as find the best
possible user experiences. Provides all project members as well as the
Ethereum ecosystem an opportunity to contribute with ideas and promotes
contributions. Addresses all submitted ideas and evaluates them for
their value and follows up on their implementation.

## Current Research Fields

### LES/2

Many participants of Ethereum in the future will bei small devices:
mobile phones as well as the IoT. These nodes are not intended to run
full nodes but need to be seamless participants of the distributed
Ethereum world. For running those small nodes Status supports Ethereum
in improving and developing the [Ethereum
Subprotocol](https://github.com/zsfelfoldi/go-ethereum/wiki/Light-Ethereum-Subprotocol-%28LES%29%7CLight).
Parts of it are

  - Observer Chain and Chain Filtering for micropayment prioritized
    service options
  - Trustless Checkpoint Syncing
  - Reduced Memory Signature

### Whisper

### Swarm
