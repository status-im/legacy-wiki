# But why?

  - Well to put it simply, there is no better way for people to
    collectively contribute to a growing knowledge base.
      - [MediaWiki](MediaWiki "wikilink") was build to do just that (the
        fact that is does only that, is a different story...)
  - It will help others, but especially **future you**
  - It will be rewarding
  - Is actually very easy to do, the leaning curve being very short
  - Your boss/team may require you to do it (no arguments there)

# Ok, but how?

1.  You need to [create an account](Special:CreateAccount "wikilink") or
    (if you have one) [login](Special:UserLogin "wikilink")
2.  Just click the "Edit" tab and you can edit.
3.  Save the page and you're done.
4.  **That's it\!**

# But I hate wiki (syntax)

  - we hear you\!
  - now we have the new [VisualEditor](VisualEditor "wikilink") in place
    so edits to pages can be made with absolutely 0 [wiki
    syntax](wiki_syntax "wikilink")
  - if you want to use pure [wiki syntax](wiki_syntax "wikilink") you
    can disable the new editor from your
    [preferences](Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing "wikilink")

# But really, stuff can be just a biiit more complicated

  - If you are part of the team and your edits are not instantly
    approved, please let us know in the \#wiki channel on slack (you
    will need to add you in the "trusted" group)
  - You may need to use [wiki syntax](wiki_syntax "wikilink") (a lot)
  - You need to write on-topic
  - Try to avoid HUGE articles, you can split them in smaller (and more
    specific) ones
  - Try to use [categories](wiki_categories "wikilink") and [internal
    linking](internal_linking "wikilink") as much as possible to avoid
    having isolated pages (no point in them being useful, if no one
    knows about them)
  - Some content may be based on [templates](wiki_templates "wikilink")
    so please try to keep that standard when adding that type of content

[category:General Wiki
Guidelines](category:General_Wiki_Guidelines "wikilink")

  - images can be uploaded directly from the upload button
    ![msu-upload-button.png](msu-upload-button.png
    "msu-upload-button.png") in the edit toolbar
  - you can user [wiki languages](multiple_languages "wikilink")

# TL;DR

  - just create and edit article and others will improve them
  - request any help in the \#wiki channel on slack
