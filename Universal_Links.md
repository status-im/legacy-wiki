## Universal Links

Note: Universal links are WIP and do not work in release builds.

#### What are Universal Links

With universal links, mobile users can tap a link to Status and get
seamlessly redirected to the Status app and deep linked to specified
screens without going through Safari or Chrome. If Status isnâ€™t
installed, tapping a link to the Status website opens a Status website
with info on the link and instructions to download the mobile app.
