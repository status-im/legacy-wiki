Here some common tasks/issues are listed along with their solutions.

## Change config and restart the service

  - ssh to the host running commiteth
  - go to `/opt/commiteth` for prod or `/opt/commiteth-test` for test
    environment.
  - there edit `config.edn`
  - restart the service with <code>sudo service commiteth-test
    restart<code>

## Manually add a GitHub repo to SOB app

Sometimes SOB will not

  - connect to Postgres instance. Get DB name and username/password from
    respective `config.edn` (see previous answer). These are set in
    `:jdbc-database-url` field.
  - execute the query,
    e.g.

<!-- end list -->

    insert into repositories(repo_id,user_id,owner,repo,hook_id,state,hook_secret,owner_avatar_url) values(116971984,447328, 'aragon', 'aragon-monthly', 0, 2, '', 'https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24612534?v=4');

Note that the value for repo_id field is GitHub's internal repo ID. One
way of obtaining it is navigating to
`api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo_name`, e.g.
<https://api.github.com/repos/aragon/aragon-monthly>.
